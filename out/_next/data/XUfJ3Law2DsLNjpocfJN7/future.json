{"pageProps":{"content":"# Kinda Predicting the Future: the Internet and the Lindy Effect\n\nNo one really knows the future,\nbut there are some pretty clear patterns worth exploring. \nOne of them is human nature and Lindy Effect.\nPowerful things when combined together.\n\n[Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) is a theory that says, in short,\nthat the longer something exists, the more likely it will survive in the future.\nIt's about things like technology, books in print, old movies that people are still watching.\n\n## Repeatable Patterns\n\nShopping with a smartphone sounds like a big, surprising shift in commerce, right?\nActually it's an effect of a pretty boring process.\nWe communicate and sell since forever.\nOnce we figured out a phone, we communicate more at a distance\nand deal with telemarketers.\nOnce we figured out the Internet, we get e-commerce, social\nmedia and email.\nSeeing that many people got email addresses, we use them to communicate\nand sell on a large scale.\nAnd once we know we can do it at low cost or no cost, we\noverdo it.  \n\nThings that can send signals remotely are\nused to communicate and do business if they support our already present thinking patterns.\nIt's never like “reshape your brain or die”.\nGood new things are based on old, proven things. When something ignores the\npast, it dies. When you see Google Maps, you know immediately that it's a map. It looks similar\nto the old ones. It could look different with todays technology, but would it be\nbetter? When patterns are familiar, you know what's going on.\n\n`2016-02-26`","title":"Kinda Predicting the Future: the Internet and the Lindy Effect"},"__N_SSG":true}

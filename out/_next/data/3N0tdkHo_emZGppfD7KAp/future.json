{"pageProps":{"htmlContent":"<h1>Kinda Predicting the Future: the Internet and the Lindy Effect</h1>\n<p>No one knows the future,\nbut there are some pretty clear patterns worth exploring.\nOne of them is human nature and Lindy Effect.\nPowerful things when combined.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect\">Lindy Effect</a> is a theory that says, in short,\nthat the longer something exists, the more likely it will survive in the future.\nIt's about things like technology, books in print, old movies that people are still watching.</p>\n<h2>Repeatable Patterns</h2>\n<p>Shopping with a smartphone sounds like a big, surprising shift in commerce, right?\nIt's an effect of a pretty boring process.\nWe communicate and sell since forever.\nOnce we figured out a phone, we communicate more at a distance\nand deal with telemarketers.\nOnce we figured out the Internet, we get e-commerce, social\nmedia and email.\nSeeing that many people got email addresses, we use them to communicate\nand sell on a large scale.\nAnd once we know we can do it at low cost or no cost, we\noverdo it.</p>\n<p>Things that can send signals remotely are\nused to communicate and do business if they support our already present thinking patterns.\nIt's never like “reshape your brain or die”.\nGood new things are based on old, proven things. When something ignores the past, it dies.\nWhen you see Google Maps, you know immediately that it's a map.\nIt looks similar to the old ones.\nIt could look different with today's technology, but would it be better?\nWhen patterns are familiar, you know what's going on.</p>\n<p><code>2016-02-26</code></p>","title":"Kinda Predicting the Future: the Internet and the Lindy Effect"},"__N_SSG":true}

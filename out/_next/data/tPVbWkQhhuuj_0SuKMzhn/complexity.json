{"pageProps":{"content":"# We're so Bad at Judging Complexity, yet We Like to Predict\n\nLiving in a bubble, the unavoidable one, makes us misjudge what are\nthe most complex things we have to face.\nWe think that some technical (software/hardware) problems are\nthe most convoluted ones, but actually, everyday things like traffic or sales are way more complex.\n\nIf you deal with software development, you have to be more analytical about dependencies and scale than salespeople or taxi drivers. But you're not in a more convoluted environment. It's just a difference in awareness.\n\nA good example of fucked-up awareness is people who eagerly try to figure out and use extremely nuanced events,\nwith confidence that it will do something positive, for sure not harm,\njust because they acquired some spreadsheet of data. Imagine management people trying to find out what their potential clients *really* want, by looking at surveys.\n\nNow let's look at one salesman. He knows that he can select and call ten\ndifferent prospects and get “no” from nine of them (maybe even all ten in a row).\nHe will keep trying.\nHe will adjust the course — build new heuristics — every time he notices a pattern.\nHowever, he will never figure out a theory that universally explains what makes people buy,\nso that he can predict decisions, or call only those who will almost for sure say “yes”.\nAnd this is OK — he will do well anyway.\nPeople like him don't bother to do much calculation or predictions.\nIt's impossible to figure out all the stuff\nthat's going on in this kind of situation.\nThey just progressively iterate, tinker, observe and judge.\nAnd they accept that they will never know everything.\n\nJust because your environment is complicated doesn't mean that you need to\nunderstand all its aspects to get by.\nIt's about iteration and a couple of good heuristics — not predictiveness.\nOn the other hand, learning something commonly known as\nhard and complicated doesn't mean that your abilities to predict the future are now greater.\nIn the big picture, it's just a bird shit –\nfar from what you need to process to get all the nuances of a market.\n\n`2018-06-01`","title":"We're so Bad at Judging Complexity, yet We Like to Predict"},"__N_SSG":true}

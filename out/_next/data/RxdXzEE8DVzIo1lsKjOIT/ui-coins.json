{"pageProps":{"content":"# Learning UI Design from Coins (on Contrast)\n\nContrast is an essential concept when it comes to UI usability. \nLet's take coins (yes, physical, metal coins) as an example.\nWhen it comes to look: at first glance you see differences in size, color (types of metals) and visual patterns.\nFeel in hand is also important. Some seem heavier than others. You can detect size by touch too.\nEach of these features is (for some was) useful in some situation.\n\nBy analogy, you can do something similar with interfaces.\nFont sizes attached to HTML tags — h1, h2, h3, p — are obvious example.\n\nForms are more tricky. Sign-up and sign-in forms often look similar and appear in similar places.\nTo create a useful contrasts we can give them different titles and labels.\nWe need to remember that users should see what's going on without careful reading.\n\n*Create an account* will make a better title than *Sign up* when there's also *Sign in* on a page.\nIf you want to stay with *Sign up*, changing *Sign in* to *Log in* will be a good idea.\n\nWhen it comes to input labels, *Your password* and *Create a password* are usefully different.\nWay better than just *Password*, which will make both forms look misleadingly similar.\n\nTwo different things need to seem different at first sight.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}

People like him don&#x27;t bother to do much calculation or predictions —
it&#x27;s impossible to figure out all the stuff

hard and complicated doesn&#x27;t mean that your abilities to predict
the future are now greater.
In the big picture it&#x27;s just a bird shit –
far from what you need to process to get all the nuances of a market (or similar <em>yuge</em> context problem).</p></article><footer class="footer_footer__3LSES"><p>©2016-2020 Bartosz Wieczorek.<br/>Some rights reserved — <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> — please attribute and link back.</p></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# We're so Bad at Judging Complexity, yet We Like to Predict\n## (Getting Perspective on Complexity)\n\nLiving in a bubble, the one that's unavoidable, makes us misjudge what are\nthe most complex things we have to face.\nWe think that some technical (software/hardware) problems are\nthe most convoluted ones, but actually, everyday things like traffic or sales are way more complex.\n\nIf you deal with software development, you have to be more analytical about dependencies and scale than sales people or taxi drivers.

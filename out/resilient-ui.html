For instance, you can make an intuitive UI while ignoring clarity of its implementation.
Sooner or later it will cause all kinds of unexpected problems.
Real simplicity of an interface means neat visuals <strong>and</strong> clear implementation.
To achieve that, you often need to sacrifice some non-crucial features.
And remember about <em>YAGNI</em>.</p><h3>Smooth Interactions</h3><p>There&#x27;s an overwhelming variety of internet browsing devices on the market.

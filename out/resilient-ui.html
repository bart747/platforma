For instance,
you can make an intuitive UI while ignoring clarity of its implementation.
Sooner or later it will cause all kinds of unexpected problems.
Real simplicity of an interface means neat visuals <strong>and</strong> clear implementation.
To achieve that, you often need to sacrifice some non-crucial features.

We need to think about what will make the product work smoothly on
a sub-average hardware and half-decent wi-fi.

airports or in restaurants.
And they will use more than one app/website at the same time.

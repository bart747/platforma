When your interface is divided into distinct parts, you can also separate chunks of code by following that divisions.

will give you more than any neophiliac thing.</p><h3>Simplicity is Tricky</h3><p>It&#x27;s easy to achieve perceived simplicity and pay for it with real complexity.
For instance, you can make an intuitive UI while ignoring clarity of its implementation.
Sooner or later it will cause all kinds of unexpected problems.
Real simplicity of an interface means neat visuals <strong>and</strong> clear implementation.
To achieve that, you often need to sacrifice some non-crucial features.
And remember about <em>YAGNI</em>.</p><h3>Smooth Interactions</h3><p>There&#x27;s an overwhelming variety of internet browsing devices on the market.
We need to think about what will make the product work smoothly on a sub-average hardware and half-decent wi-fi.

But a picture will not make a proposition as clear and precise as a well designed sentence or phrase.
Text is also trivial to edit.

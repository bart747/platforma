# Learning UI Design from Coins (on Contrast)

Contrast is an essential concept when it comes to UI usability. 
Let's take coins (yes, physical, metal coins) as an example.
When it comes to look: at first glance you see differences in size, color (types of metals) and visual patterns.
Feel in hand is also important. Some seem heavier than others. You can detect size by touch too.
Each of these features is (for some was) useful in some situation.

By analogy, you can do something similar with interfaces.
Font sizes attached to HTML tags — h1, h2, h3, p — are obvious example.

Forms are more tricky. Sign-up and sign-in forms often look similar and appear in similar places.
To create a useful contrasts we can give them different titles and labels.
We need to remember that users should see what's going on without careful reading.

*Create an account* will make a better title than *Sign up* when there's also *Sign in* on a page.
If you want to stay with *Sign up*, changing *Sign in* to *Log in* will be a good idea.

When it comes to input labels, *Your password* and *Create a password* are usefully different.
Way better than just *Password*, which will make both forms look misleadingly similar.

Two different things need to seem different at first sight.

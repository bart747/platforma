which includes so called “industry standards,” is so on point.
An average set of methods of the top 50% of professionalsis a way different

Below is a couple of quotes of people who did something right and we can learn from.
It&#x27;s not a kind of content you see often.
There are many programs written in contradiction to these ideas.

Somehow the idea of reusability got attached to object-oriented programming
in the 1980s, and no amount of evidence to the contrary seems to be able
to shake it free. But although some object-oriented software is reusable,
what makes it reusable is its bottom-upness, not its object-orientedness.
Consider libraries: they're reusable because they're language,
whether they're written in an object-oriented style or not.</div><p>— Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html"><em>The Hundred-Year Language</em></a>.</p><span></blockquote></span><br/><div><div class="video-wrapper">

If you have referentially transparent code,
if you have pure functions — all the data comes in its input arguments

ever-breaking links, links going outward only,

its opponents and making them see the light,
but rather because its opponents eventually die,
and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work
of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of
science are written the words: <em>Ye must have faith</em>.
It is a quality which the scientist cannot dispense with.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Again and again the imaginary plan on which one attempts to build up
that order breaks down and then we must try another.
This imaginative vision and faith in the ultimate success
are indispensable.
<em>The pure rationalist has no place here.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>New scientific ideas never spring from a communal body,
however organized, but rather from the head of an individually
inspired researcher who struggles with his problems in lonely
thought and unites all his thought on one single point which is
his whole world for the moment.</p></blockquote><p>More at <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Planck Wikiquote</a>.</p><p><small>2016-09-09</small></p></article><footer class="footer_footer__3LSES"><p>©2016-2021 Bartosz Wieczorek.<br/>Some rights reserved — <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> — please attribute and link back.</p></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Max Planck on New Ideas and Creative Work\n\nHere are few famous quotes related to [creative work](https://bart747.github.io/process/), by Max Planck:\n\n\u003e A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing\nits opponents and making them see the light,\nbut rather because its opponents eventually die,\nand a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\n\n\u003e Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work\nof any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of\nscience are written the words: *Ye must have faith*.\nIt is a quality which the scientist cannot dispense with.\n\n\u003e Again and again the imaginary plan on which one attempts to build up\nthat order breaks down and then we must try another.\nThis imaginative vision and faith in the ultimate success\nare indispensable.\n*The pure rationalist has no place here.*\n\n\u003e New scientific ideas never spring from a communal body,\nhowever organized, but rather from the head of an individually\ninspired researcher who struggles with his problems in lonely\nthought and unites all his thought on one single point which is\nhis whole world for the moment.\n\nMore at [Planck Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Max_Planck).\n\n\u003csmall\u003e2016-09-09\u003c/small\u003e\n","title":"Max Planck on New Ideas and Creative Work"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[mdslug]","query":{"mdslug":"planck"},"buildId":"m_iR47FH0ZniPYOuCXokG","isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-4f14e8c8ea1352d3ef0d.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.15878d4e523f86636251.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/3ef630e34cd10ba68f9d468ac363ff81c534e1e9.ee8c39519a2bf016e5e1.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-66bcc2b42ce95392a33a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-1bebc47bfc15c934c94f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/%5Bmdslug%5D-14e1059e64c08a61f37b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/m_iR47FH0ZniPYOuCXokG/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/m_iR47FH0ZniPYOuCXokG/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>

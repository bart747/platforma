No one really knows the future,
but there are some pretty clear patterns worth exploring. 
One of them is human nature and Lindy Effect.
Powerful things when combined together.

[Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) is a theory that says, in short, that the longer something exists, 
the more likely it will survive in the future. It's about things like
technology, books in print, old movies that people are still watching.

## Repeatable Patterns

Shopping with a smartphone sounds like a big, surprising shift in commerce, right?
Actually it's an effect of a pretty boring process.
We communicate and sell since forever.
Once we figured out a phone, we communicate more at a distance
and deal with telemarketers.
Once we figured out the Internet, we get e-commerce, social
media and email.
Seeing that many people got email addresses, we use them to communicate
and sell on a large scale.
And once we know we can do it at low cost or no cost, we
overdo it.  

Things that can send signals remotely are
used to communicate and do business if they support our already present thinking patterns.
It's never like “reshape your brain or die”.
Good new things are based on old, proven things. When something ignores the
past, it dies. When you see Google Maps, you know immediately that it's a map. It looks similar
to the old ones. It could look different with todays technology, but would it be
better? When patterns are familiar, you know what's going on.

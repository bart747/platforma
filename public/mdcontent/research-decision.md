More often than not, research is something that prevents you from making a decision.
You want to be sure, so you seek more.
But your brain is somehow full of doubts all the time, no matter what you know.

You think you should have so clear picture in your head,
that when you start coding you're sure it will be great.
If you're not, you're looking for information farther.

All that pushes you away from reality.

It's much better to prototype fast â€“ do something that barely works.
Than it's no longer just a picture in your head [no longer just a picture in your head](https://bart747.github.io/process/).
It's clickable.
You can see actual performance.

Then, if you **know where you're going**, you know how to correct the course.
You make a decision about the next move and stop looking for crystal balls.

BTW, have you heard about [The Foolscap Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8sqQ_p6aR8)?

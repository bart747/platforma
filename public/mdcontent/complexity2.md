# We're so Bad at Judging Complexity, yet We Like to Predict
## (Getting Perspective on Complexity)

Living in a bubble, the one that's unavoidable, makes us misjudge what are
the most complex things we have to face.
We think that some technical (software/hardware) problems are
the most convoluted ones, but actually,
everyday things like traffic or sales are way more complex.

If you deal with software development,
you have to be more analytical about dependencies and scale than
sales people or taxi drivers. But you're not in a more convoluted environment.
It's just a difference in awareness.

Good example of bad awareness are people who eagerly try to figure out
extremely nuanced events,
with confidence that it will do something positive, for sure not harm,
just because they acquired some software to do some statistics.
Imagine management people trying to find out what their potential clients
really want, by looking at stats and surveys.

Now lets look at one salesman. He knows that he can select and call ten
different prospects and get “no” from nine of them (or even all ten).
He will keep trying. He will
adjust the course — build new heuristics — every time he notices a pattern.
However, he will never figure
out a theory that universally explains what makes people buy, so that he
can predict decisions, or call only those who will almost for sure say “yes”.
And this will be OK — he will do well anyway.
People like him don't bother to do much calculation or predictions —
it's impossible to figure out all the stuff
that's going on in this kind of situation.
They just progressively iterate, tinker, observe and judge.
And they accept that they will never know everything.

Just because your environment is complicated doesn't mean that you need to
understand all its aspects to get by.
It's about iteration and couple of good heuristics — not predictiveness.
On the other hand, learning something commonly known as
hard and complicated doesn't mean that your abilities to predict
the future are now greater.
In the big picture it's just a bird shit –
far from what you need to process to get all the nuances of a market
(or similar *yuge* context problem).

A page with a final “buy” button or a credit card data form
is a huge friction trigger.
It's the moment when you, as a buyer, think again about expense
and transaction safety.
The fact that you're about to say bye to some of your money triggers that.

From a designer's point of view, it's a good place and moment to do a little
summary (again).
To remind a user about things like return policy, transaction safety
and shipping time.

Even if you did that earlier in the process,
it's sometimes good to repeat yourself.
Especially when it's about user's money or privacy.  

It will make the process appear safer. There will be fewer users moving step or
two back to just in case check data again.
